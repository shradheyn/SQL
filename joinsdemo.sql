# SQL Joins
-- A join is a method of linking data between one (self-join) or 
-- more tables based on values of the common column between the tables.

/* MySQL supports the following types of joins:

Inner join
Left join
Right join
Cross join */

-- Inner Join - Returns only matching records from 2 tables

/* SELECT
    select_list
FROM t1
INNER JOIN t2 ON join_condition1
INNER JOIN t3 ON join_condition2
...; */

# lEFT OUTER JOIN
-- LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table regardless of whether a row 
-- from the left table has a matching row from the right table or not. 
-- If there is no match, the columns of the row from the right table will contain NULL.

-- This query uses the LEFT JOIN clause to find all customers and their orders:
SELECT * FROM customers;
SELECT * FROM orders;

SELECT c.customernumber,customername,ordernumber,IFNULL(STATUS,'no orders')
FROM customers c LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber ORDER BY STATUS DESC;


-- Left Join to find customers who have no order
SELECT c.customernumber,c.customername,o.ordernumber,STATUS FROM customers c
 LEFT JOIN orders o
  ON c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber WHERE ordernumber IS NULL;


-- Query to display All OrderNumbers, and their matching
-- CustomerNo & Prdct Code of 10123

SELECT o.ordernumber,o.customernumber,d.productcode FROM orders o
 LEFT JOIN orderdetails d
  ON o.orderNumber=d.orderNumber AND o.ordernumber=10123;


		
# RIGHT JOIN
-- RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right table regardless of 
-- having matching rows from the left table or not.

-- Query to display all Sales Rep , customer Id & Customer Name 

SELECT c.customernumber,c.customername,e.firstname 'sales rep' FROM customers c
 RIGHT  JOIN employees e
  ON c.salesrepemployeenumber=e.employeeNumber;

SELECT c.customerNumber, e.employeeNumber
	FROM customers c
		RIGHT  JOIN employees e
			ON c.salesRepEmployeeNumber=e.employeeNumber
				ORDER BY e.employeeNumber;

#Full Outer Join

-- returns all rows from the left table (table1) and from the 
-- right table (table2).
-- MY SQL DOESNOT SUPPORT FULL JOIN.. INSTEAD USE UNION WITH LEFT/RIGHT JOINS
SELECT t1.customerNumber, customerName, orderNumber, status from 
customers t1
		LEFT JOIN orders t2
				ON t1.customerNumber=t2.customerNumber
UNION
			
SELECT c.customerNumber, customerName, orderNumber, status from 
customers c
		RIGHT JOIN orders o
				ON c.customerNumber=o.customerNumber;



#Self Join
-- The self join is often used to query hierarchical data or to compare a row 
-- with other rows within the same table.
-- Joining a table to Itself, by Creating a virtual copy of a Table
USE classicmodels;
SELECT * FROM employees;

SELECT e.employeenumber, CONCAT(e.firstname,' ',e.lastname) employee, CONCAT(m.firstname,' ',m.lastname) AS 'reportsto'
FROM employees e LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.reportsto=m.employeeNumber;

#Sub Query

-- A MySQL subquery is a query that is nested inside another query.
-- A MySQL subquery is called an inner query while the query that contains the 
-- subquery is called an outer query.
-- Sub query acts a criteria for Outer query.
-- Syntax: SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE column1 = (SELECT column1 FROM t2);
